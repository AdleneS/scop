# ft_vox

## Objectives

This project aims to confront you to a graphic project that will be extremely demanding
in terms of optimization. You will have to study the characteristics of the voxel worlds,
and use them along your infographics knowledge to display a lot of elements on screen.
Thus, you will have to study different algo/opti to obtain a SMOOTH render (there are
many of them). You will also have to manage your memory and data structures properly
to be able to travel in a very, very large universe. Once you have achieved that, you will
be ready to get to the next level with the project ft_minecraft, which will be even more
demanding.
